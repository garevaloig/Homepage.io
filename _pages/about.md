I am a final year PhD candidate at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences.

From the 1st of November 2025, I will join the Department of Political Science of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) as a postdoctoral researcher in the project 'Breaking the Silence: Politics, Workers’ Rights and the Future of Senior Care in Europe' funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO-VIDI).

My research interests are in social policy, family sociology and public opinion.

Doctoral research
======
My dissertation 'Familialism Begets Familialism? How Family Solidarity Shapes Welfare Preferences in Europe', explores how family structures and patterns of familial support influence individuals' preferences for welfare policies. 
Specifically, it investigates the following questions:

- In what ways does receiving family support for social risks—such as youth unemployment or the need for elderly care—shape individuals' willingness to endorse public policies addressing the same risks?
- Conversely, how does providing such support within families influence attitudes toward state intervention in these areas?
- How do social policies differentiate between family types in distributing benefits, services, and tax responsibilities, and what impact does this have on public support for these policies?
- How do national differences in social policy and family norms influence the dynamics described above?

To address these questions, I analyze cross-national survey data within the European context, drawing on sources such as the European Social Survey and the Generations and Gender Survey.

This dissertation was submitted in July, 2025 and the dissertation defense is schedule for the 23rd of October, 2025.
