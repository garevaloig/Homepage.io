I am a final year PhD candidate at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences.

My research interests are in social policy, family sociology and public opinion.

Doctoral research
======
In my dissertation I examine the role of family constellations and family solidarity arrangements as an explanatory factor for welfare preferences.



My research focuses on the formation of welfare preferences, particularly how these are affected by the interplay between family solidarity dynamics and social policy.
I study these issues from a compararative perspective in the European context through the analysis of cross-country survey data.
