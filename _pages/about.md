I am a final year PhD candidate at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences.

My research interests are in social policy, family sociology and public opinion.

Doctoral research
======
In my dissertation I examine the role of family constellations and family solidarity arrangements as an explanatory factor for welfare preferences.
The following questions are addressed:
- How does **receiving** family support against social risks such as youth unemployment or old-age care needs affect the incentives to support social policies that cover the same risks?
- Consequently, how does **providing** family support against these social risks affect the incentives to support the corresponding social policies?
- How do social policies target different family types when distributing benefits, services and tax obligations, and how does this targeting affect support for such policies?
- How do national contexts differ in terms of social policy and family norms, and how do these differences moderate the relationships proposed above?

I study these issues through the analysis of cross-country survey data for the European context, such as the European Social Survey or the Generations and Gender Survey.
