I am a final year PhD candidate at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences.

My research interests are in social policy, family sociology and public opinion.

Doctoral research
======
My dissertation explores how family structures and patterns of familial support influence individuals' preferences for welfare policies. 
Specifically, it investigates the following questions:

- In what ways does receiving family support for social risks—such as youth unemployment or the need for elderly care—shape individuals' willingness to endorse public policies addressing the same risks?
- Conversely, how does providing such support within families influence attitudes toward state intervention in these areas?
- How do social policies differentiate between family types in distributing benefits, services, and tax responsibilities, and what impact does this have on public support for these policies?
- How do national differences in social policy and family norms influence the dynamics described above?

To address these questions, I analyze cross-national survey data within the European context, drawing on sources such as the European Social Survey and the Generations and Gender Survey.
