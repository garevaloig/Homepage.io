I am a quantitative social scientist with a focus on comparative social policy, public opinion and family sociology.

Current research
======

Since November 2025, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam’s Department of Political Science, working on the NWO-VIDI–funded project “Breaking the Silence: Politics, Workers’ Rights and the Future of Senior Care in Europe.

Doctoral research
======
Between 2021 and 2025, I completed my PhD at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences, University of Bremen.

My dissertation 'Familialism Begets Familialism? How Family Solidarity Shapes Welfare Preferences in Europe', explores how family structures and patterns of familial support influence individuals' preferences for welfare policies. 
Specifically, it investigates the following questions:

- In what ways does receiving family support for social risks—such as youth unemployment or the need for elderly care—shape individuals' willingness to endorse public policies addressing the same risks?
- Conversely, how does providing such support within families influence attitudes toward state intervention in these areas?
- How do social policies differentiate between family types in distributing benefits, services, and tax responsibilities, and what impact does this have on public support for these policies?
- How do cross-national differences in social policy and family norms influence the dynamics described above?

To address these questions, I analysed cross-national survey data within the European context, drawing on sources such as the European Social Survey and the Generations and Gender Survey.

I defended my dissertation in October 2025, receiving a 'pass with distinction'.
